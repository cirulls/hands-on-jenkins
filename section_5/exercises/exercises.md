## Section 5: Exercises

### Theory

1. Which are the advantages of using Blue Ocean? 

2. Which kind of tasks in Jenkins cannot be done via the Blue Ocean user interface? 
3. What is a multibranch pipeline?

4. What is a pull request?

### Practice

1. Create a new pipeline with the visual editor but instead of outputting dummy message try to make it do something useful (e.g. build a web application, deploy it on localhost, and ping it). Use your favourite programming language and store the code in your repository on GitHub. 

2. Create a new multibranch pipeline using the Jenkinfile employed in section 4. Make sure to put it at the root of a GitHub repository and use the master branch. 

3. If you have the chance to deploy Jenkins on a domain name or on an IP address, try to replace the polling in Jenkins with a push notification from GitHub. [This link](https://medium.com/@marc_best/trigger-a-jenkins-build-from-a-github-push-b922468ef1ae) explains how to set up a push notification from GitHub to Jenkins.
