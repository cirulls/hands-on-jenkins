## Section 6: Exercises

### Theory

1. What are the benefits of using a master/slave architecture in Jenkins? 

2. What are the differences between a single master and a multi master configuration? 
 
3. What is a VPC in AWS? 

4. What is a security group in AWS?

5. What is IAM in AWS? What is a IAM policy?

### Practice

1. Create another slave node with a different label name and set up a Jenkins job that runs solely on that node.   

2. Instead of running a dummy job on the slave, make it run something useful (e.g. tests). For example, you could run the web application created in section 4 on an EC2 instance and then use a slave node to run acceptance tests.
